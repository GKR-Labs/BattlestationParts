# Summary

These are brackets for hanging a USB audio interface under your desk.  Screw holes are provided for attaching to the desk.  They were modeled specifically for a Behringer U-Phoria UMC404HD, but will fit the UCM204HD, UMC22, etc.  

This was modeled with a bit of extra clearance so that the unit fits securely by means of some thin rubber sheet between the interface and the brackets.

I think these will work for other similar sized models such as Focusrite Scarlett, and would appreciate feedback if you try.  The "grip thickness" is approximately 1.8 inches, and they can be installed at any width.

Prints without supports.
